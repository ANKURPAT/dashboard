# Security Policy

We welcome any security issues that you find and we'll try to address them as quickly as possible in the form of a new Tekton Dashboard release.


## Supported Versions

As the Tekton Dashboard is not considered "beta", unlike Tekton Pipelines, security fixes are most likely to make the form into releases only into the master branch (and thus any subsequent releases would contain the fix) and v0.6.1.2. This is due to several high importance security issues already being fixed in this release and so previous releases should only be installed with caution into isolated development environments only.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| master   | :white_check_mark: |\
| v0.6.1.2   | :white_check_mark: |
